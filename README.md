Cool little terminal log system. Another fun little quick project :D

- Terminal based log system with simple arrow key navigation or W and S keys
- Save logs & loads with a Json file

## How to use
- Run using 'dotnet run' cli command. You probably need the dotnet sdk.
- The login password is 'khaled'
